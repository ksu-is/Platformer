# Platformer
* My plan for the final project is to make a video game using the Pygame module for Python. The game will be a platformer, meaning players will explore levels from a 2D perspective where they navigate by jumping on ‘platforms’. The basis for the design of the game comes from classics such as Jazz Jackrabbit and Commander Keen. Some features that will likely be implemented are multiple levels, different environments, weapons, enemies, and a final boss. The game itself will be short in length, consisting of a few levels that culminate into a final boss. For the art of the game, I will use either free art assets or design simplistic shapes in order to focus more on the programming side of things.
* Video games are a very popular software product, and I picked it as the basis of this project because of the relevant experience it could provide. Video games are built on a backbone of programming, and it’s nigh impossible to make a game without it. I plan to do this project solo, as game design is a topic that is important to me and I would love to put my creativity toward it. I will look at tutorials and examine other projects on sites such as Github and SourceForge to use as the basis for my code. Here are some examples of the relevant projects I have found so far:
